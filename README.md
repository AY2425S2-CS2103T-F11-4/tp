* CS2103T tP
* This is **a loan manager to help users track and improve their lending habits**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Track individuals' loans and due dates to manage repayments effectively. 
  * Identify and list individuals with overdue loans to improve lending decisions
* `Wanted` is adapted from an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) to instead manage loans given to friends.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Wanted`  because it aims to display a list of individuals who have not returned their loans.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Wanted_Product_Website](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-f11-4.github.io/tp/)**.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)
