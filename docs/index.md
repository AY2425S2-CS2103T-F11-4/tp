**Wanted List is a desktop application for managing your loans.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Wanted List, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-f11-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html).
* If you are interested about developing WantedList, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2425s2-cs2103t-f11-4.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
